      <h3>Carmel, Age: 14/15
        (My Cat) </h3>
      <p>He is such an old man. He has my entire heart. It was a chilly night in October of 2004. My brother and I were putting out decorations like we are Martha Stewart or some shit like that. Carmel comes up to us and lets us know that he wants to live with us. We took him in and loved him every since.</p>

      <h3>Cole, Age: 8 (Dad's dog)</h3>
      <p>He is a purebred lab who was rescued from a hunter who was going to kill him. The hunter tried to train him to be a bird dog, but Cole failed. COLE IS A FAILED BIRD DOG. Too stubborn... but we love him anyway. We don't bring up his failure, though. His previous owner was such a jackass. His current owners love him dearly. </p>

      <h3>June, Age: 2 (Mom's dog)</h3>
      <p>We raised this long baby since she was a puppy. She is wild, but sometimes gentle. She also likes to pester my cat Carmel.</p>

      <h3>Bella, Age: ?? (Dad's cat) </h3>
      <p>We call her the Dumpster Cat. Why? Because that's where we found her. Hiding under a dumpster. She's a sweet cat and is great around children, for some reason. </p>
